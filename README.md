## Overview
This project explores the California housing dataset using Seaborn to visualise relationships between key housing factors. The analysis emphasises properties in the Bay Area compared to other regions of Northern California, examining differences in house values, population, household size, income, and age of the main householder.

## Motivation
Having spent a lot of time in California before, especially around the Bay Area and other parts of Northern California, I enjoyed connecting the dataset to real-world observations. My experience in real estate helped me interpret the visualisations in a practical context, highlighting potential patterns for individuals who are considering housing in California. 

## Visualisations Included
1. Geographical Distribution of Housing – Scatter plot showing the location of properties by ocean proximity, highlighting Bay Area clustering.
2. House Values by Location – KDE plot showing that Bay Area properties tend to have higher values compared to other regions.
3. Housing Median Age by Location – Boxplot comparing the age distribution of houses in Bay Area vs other areas.
4. Pair Plot: Housing Age vs Median Income – Explores how income and housing age relate across locations, with emphasis on the Bay Area.
5. Population vs Households – Scatter plot revealing population density and household size differences by location.

## Personal Takeaways
- The Bay Area clearly stands out in terms of higher property values, median income, and unique housing characteristics. It's also a scarce location, there will be higheer demand for it. 
- Combining data analysis with personal experience made the project engaging and insightful.

## Fun Note
If you ever visit San Francisco, don’t miss Half Moon Bay Beach — one of my personal favourite beaches along the California coast.
